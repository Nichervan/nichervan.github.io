			<h1>About Me</h1>
			
			<p>My name is Nichervan and I'm originally from Syria, from a small city called Qamshli. I finished high school with good marks and entered the English Literature program at Tishreen University. That was a very good start for a new life, with new friends and new teachers. I finished the first three years with good marks, but I didn't receive my certificate because of the war in Syria. It was so hard to leave my colleagues, but we decided to fly to Kurdistan because of the harsh situation in my city.</p></div><br>

				<h1>Why I Joined the Re:Coded Program</h1>

				<p>In July 2016, I heard about the Re:Coded program and decided to sign up because I wanted to do something new with my life. I had an amazing experience in the program from day one. In this course, I met new people from different countries and great trainers who helped us to learn many programming languages like CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, and Ruby on Rails. In addition, we also learned English language and professional skills.   </p><br>

				<h1>What I Want to do After Re:Coded</h1>

				<p>When I finish Re:Coded, I would love to keep learning about coding languages. I would also like to teach coding courses for children as I believe having these skills opens up a whole new world of opportunity. </p>
